%description
Certifi is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for validating
the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS
hosts. It has been extracted from the Requests project.

Please note that this Fedora package does not actually include a certificate
collection at all. It reads the system shared certificate trust collection
instead. For more details on this system, see the ca-certificates package.
