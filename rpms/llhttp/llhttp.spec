# This package is rather exotic. The compiled library is a typical shared
# library with a C API. However, it has only a tiny bit of C source code. Most
# of the library is written in TypeScript, which is transpiled to C, via LLVM
# IR, using llparse (https://github.com/nodejs/llparse)—all of which happens
# within the NodeJS ecosystem.
#
# Historically, this package “built like” a NodeJS package, with a
# dev-dependency bundle from NPM that we used to transpile the original
# TypeScript sources to C downstream. Since 9.3.0, it is no longer practical to
# re-generate the C sources from Typescript without using pre-compiled esbuild
# executables from NPM, so we use the upstream “release” tarball with
# pre-generated C source and header files included.
#
# That allows this package to be built without running the NodeJS/Typescript
# machinery in the build (via a large “dev” dependency bundle. However, this
# release archive lacks the original TypeScript source code for the generated C
# code, so we need to include this in an additional source. For details, see:
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/what-can-be-packaged/#pregenerated-code

# This package is a dependency of libgit2 which in turn is one of rpmautospec.
# When upgrading to a version with a new soname, this package needs to provide
# both in order to bootstrap itself and libgit2. Set %%bootstrap and
# %%previous_so_version for this (and unset and rebuild later).

%description
This project is a port of http_parser to TypeScript. llparse is used to
generate the output C source file, which could be compiled and linked with the
embedder's program (like Node.js).
